Thanks for downloading SCFFLD!

I think you're going to like this framework. It's designed to be easy to use and very quick to learn. For documentation on using the framework, visit http://iamtimsmith.github.io/scffld. SCFFLD is a mobile first framwork built using SASS. 

To get started, simply add the following code to your website's head:
<link href="css/base.css" rel="stylesheet">

If using SASS:
Within the /scss folder, there is a file called _custom.scss. This is the file that should be used for custom styles on your site. It will be loaded into the framework after all of the other styles have been applied.

If using CSS:
If you've never heard of SASS or have heard of it but don't know anything about it, I would recommend checking out http://sass-lang.com. It will walk you through installing SASS as well has how to use the language. If this is too much or just makes you uncomfortable, you can create a css file for your custom styles and just place a link to it in the head of your document. Just make sure to put the link after your link for SCFFLD to ensure that your custom styles are loaded last.
